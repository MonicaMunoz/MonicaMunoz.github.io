<h1>Artist statement</h1>
<p>I work with Digital media-based art. Currently, I produce most of my work in the digital format to better show my techniques. As a Digital media artist, I explore major themes such as inequitable immigration policies, technology, and aesthetic principles. Through a wide variety of mediums such as digital software, paint, photography, and sculpture. In my artworks, you will find abstract video art, game art, art designs in processing software, net-art, and illustrations both in graphite and paint. In my recent work, Minaâ€™s Braids, I demonstrate the representation of the durational/ endurance of the constant activity that is experienced between a mother and her child. I showcase a variety of braided hairstyles that transpire memories and valuable time.  </p>
