  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <h2> My name is Monica Munoz. I am a Digital arts Major. As an artist, I care about giving my viewers video art that is considered more conceptual and educational. I think that art can be expressed in many ways as something pleasing to look at and didactic in a simultaneous manner. In the web based art I have created , I incorporated concepts such as beauty and art and how we view beauty in different ways.

The first video is about social media and immigration. I chose this topic because I believe that social media has become a very important source of information that if used efficiently, can be extremely beneficial. In this case, immigrants have taken advantage of social media such as facebook to get informed of what can potentially affect them. As a child of immigrant parents, I can completely relate to the hardships that many endure to be in the US. My second video is about global warming and the effects it has on our planet. This topic is something that is widely spoken about but not much has been done about it. Since it's a subject that highly interests me, it was definitely a must to show in my video. Lastly, I enjoy coding and using technology as a way to show my artwork. Creating net art was very enjoyable to create and will absolutely be part of some of my future artworks.  </h2>
